# SMU Smart City GenAI Hackathon

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the SMU Smart City GenAI Hackathon project, leveraging GenAI technologies to address challenges in smart city development.

## 1. Installing Dependencies

Before you begin, install the necessary Python dependencies. Run the following commands:
```bash
pip install ollama  
pip install flask  
pip install flask_cors  
pip install chromadb  
pip install requests  
```
## 2. Downloading Ollama Models

You need to download the required Ollama model. Use the following command:
```bash
ollama pull aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sea-lionv2-instruct  
```
## 3. Starting Ollama Server

Start the Ollama server with the following command:
```bash
ollama serve  
```
## 4. Storing Embeddings in ChromaDB

Run the script to store embeddings in ChromaDB:
The current dataset generates 213 chunks
```bash
python process.py  
```
## 5. Starting Flask Server

Next, start the Flask server to serve the application:
```bash
python prompt.py  
```
## 6. Open the Webpage

Finally, open the `app.html` file in your browser to access the web application.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that your environment is properly set up for the required dependencies and models.
- If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please open an issue on this repository.

## Future Improvements
- Graph and Statistical Data Parsing
To enhance the chatbotâ€™s capabilities, we aim to integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and data extraction techniques to interpret and process visual data, such as graphs and charts

- Reranking
To improve the relevance and quality of responses, we plan to implement a reranking mechanism. Currently, the chatbot retrieves the top results based on similarity scores from the vector database. However, these results may not always align perfectly with the user's query intent

- Dynamic Chunking
We should implement dynamic chunking based on the complexity of the input data, optimizing performance further
